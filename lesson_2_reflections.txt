What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	-A folder with the name '.git' is added.
	To differentiate it from the other non-git directories.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	-It can be said to be intermediate of the two.
	Before getting committed, the files are added into the staging area.
	-Value: We can undo our decision to commit a file after adding into the staging area and also it helps to make a part of the repository to be commtted so as to make logical commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	-Add only one file in the stage area and then commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	-When we want to make slightly different versions of the code and don't want to disturb the progress of the original code.
	-When we have different logical branches, we can easily track history of each branch.
	-Like Context Switching
	-Helpful when u are sharing ur code publicly:
		Your Master branch will be the Quality Production branch that will never break.
		And we can have a Development branch on which currently active work is going on.
		Others: Experimental branch, a new fature branch(which u are working on and fully expecting to break)
	-If working on a feature but have to go back and fix a bug on the master branch and then come back on the feature branch.
	-For easy collaboration when working in a team.
