When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
  -When I am working in a team and simultaneosly other team members have to contribute OR when I am working
  from a different machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	-Because maybe some other people contribute on GitHub which we don't want to add to our local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	-Fork: Getting a copy of a repository on Github to Github.
	-Clone: Getting a copy of a repository on Github to local machine.
	-Branch: Making a copy of an existing repository for experimenting/adding new feature.
